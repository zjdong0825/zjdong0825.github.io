    - title: Ultrafast 3D Ultrasound Imaging Using Fast-tilting and Redirecting Re- flectors
      institution: "Advisor: Prof. Pengfei Song, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"
      year: 2019 - Present
      description:
        - Proposed a new 3D ultrasound imaging technique called Fast Acoustic Steering via Tilting Electromechanical Reflectors (FASTER).
        - Achieved high volume-rate 3D ultrasound imaging using FASTER with conven- tional 1D array transducers.
        - Apply FASTER 3D imaging in different imaging modalities such as shear wave imaging and ultrasound microvessel imaging
    - title: Nonparametric Preference Completion with Pairwise Preference
      institution: "Advisor: Prof. Clayton Scott, University of Michigan"
      year: 2018
      description:
        - Used a k-nearest neighbors-like algorithm to implement preference completion with pairwise preference in a nonparametric setting.
        - Established a probability bound of ranking mistakes, which tends to zero in the limiting situation.

    - title: Histotripsy System Implementation
      institution: "Advisor: Prof. Zhen Xu and Dr. Tim Hall, University of Michigan"
      year: 2018
      description:
        - Implemented the receiving part of the next generation of Histotripsy system that includes both transmit and receive capability for Non-invasive Ultrasonic Tissue Surgery.
        - Used FPGA and HPS to implement ultrasound signal conversion, processing, and transmission with high speed and resolution.

    - title: Machine Learning Based Link Adaptation for MIMO System
      institution: "Advisor: Prof. Xiqi Gao and Prof. Wenjin Wang, Southeast University"
      year: 2016-2017
      description:
        - Proposed a link adaptation scheme in MIMO-OFDM systems through machine learning algorithms to maximize spectral efficiency while maintaining transmis- sion reliability.
        - Used Autoencoder architecture to extract features from channel state informa- tion (CSI) and exploited intrinsic connection between measurement data and adaptation scheme.
