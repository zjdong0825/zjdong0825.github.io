I’m a tech enthusiast with a deep curiosity for imaging reconstruction, real-time signal processing, and deep learning. I enjoy exploring cutting-edge technologies and finding innovative ways to solve complex problems.

Outside of work, I love hiking, optimizing my Vim config, and spending time with my dog, Beta—a energic corgi who keeps me on my toes.
