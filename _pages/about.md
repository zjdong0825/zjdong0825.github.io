I am a Senior Systems Engineer at [iota Biosciences](https://iota.bio), where I develop and integrate advanced signal/image processing and machine learning solutions for next-generation biomedical devices. I finished my Ph.D. in the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). Previsouly, I obtained my B.E. degree in 2017 from the [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) and my M.S. degree in 2018 from the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu).
