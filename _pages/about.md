I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). I obtained my B.E. degree in 2017 from the [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) and my M.S. degree in 2018 from the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu).

I am in [Song Lab @ UIUC](https://songp.ece.illinois.edu) and advised by Prof. Pengfei Song. Currently my research interests include 3D ultrafast ultrasound imaging, deep learning in ultrasond, and medical imaging processing.
