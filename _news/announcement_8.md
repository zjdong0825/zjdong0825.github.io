Check out our latest TUFFC paper introducing a novel [3D shear wave elastography (SWE) method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10438468) based on 2D row-column-addressing (RCA) array. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that acoustic radiation force-based 3D SWE is demonstrated on 2D RCAs.
