Check out our latest preprint introducing a novel [3D shear wave elastography (SWE) method](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.18.541365v1) based on 2D row-column-addressing (RCA) array. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that acoustic radiation force-based 3D SWE is demonstrated on 2D RCAs.
